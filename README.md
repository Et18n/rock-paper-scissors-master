## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use the Math.random() function to generate the pick for the machine part of the game.
I also learned to implement a js object and use the js local storage to store the score of the game.

I also tinkered a bit with the keyframes and animations in css to make the game more appealing to the user.

### Continued development

I would like to continue to work on the design of the game and make it more appealing to the user. I would also like to add the bonus part of the challenge, which is to add the Lizard and Spock options to the game.
